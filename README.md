# Motor-Controller
The UAHEV Motor Controller Software Repo

Motor controllers in this repo are all run on an Atmega 328/328p. The controller relies on the [FastPWM](https://github.com/UAHEV/FastPWM "FastPWM") library in some form or another, though all should build correctly with the current version.
